# Code Pattern Learnings

This directory contains learnings about successful code patterns discovered during implementation.

## Categories

- **dbt-models**: Patterns for dbt model development
- **sql-patterns**: SQL query patterns and conventions
- **python-patterns**: Python coding patterns

## When Patterns Are Captured

Code patterns are captured when the agent:
1. Successfully implements a feature following repository conventions
2. Discovers patterns that work well for specific use cases
3. Learns project-specific coding standards

## Using Patterns

These patterns help the agent:
- Follow consistent coding conventions
- Use established project patterns
- Avoid anti-patterns that have caused issues
